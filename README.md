## Self Learning

### Self Learning Resources

**Books**
* [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow/dp/1787125939) by Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili.
>  Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.
> Online version of the book can be found [@GitHub](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-2nd-edition)
* [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291)
> Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems
* [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438) by Francois Chollet (the founder of [Keras](https://keras.io/) language)
> Deep Learning with Python introduces the field of deep learning using the Python language and the powerful Keras library. Written by Keras creator and Google AI researcher FranÃ§ois Chollet, this book builds your understanding through intuitive explanations and practical examples.
* [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Aaron Courville and Yoshua Bengio
* [Reinforcement Learning, Second Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reinforcement-learning-second-edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
> This second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.

**Papers**

## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.
